# FestWithMe
Web-based application built with _React_, _Redux_, _Node_ and _MongoDB_. 

It obtains data from **ResidentAdvisor**, **AirBnb** and **Kiwi.com** to calculate a price estimate for going to a festival / electronic music event abroad.

The web app is available [here](https://fest-with-me.herokuapp.com/?demo=true). 

_Note: I haven't got much time to maintain the app at the moment, so that's why I've only given the demo url.To view the results just click on the search button_ üòÅ
